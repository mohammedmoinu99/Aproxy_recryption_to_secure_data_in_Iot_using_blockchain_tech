# Aproxy_recryption_to_secure_data_in_Iot_using_blockchain_tech
The evolution of the Internet of Things has seen data sharing as one of its most useful applications in cloud computing. As eye-catching as this technology has been, data security remains one of the obstacles it faces  since the wrongful use of data leads to several damages. In this article, we propose a proxy re-encryption 
approach to secure data sharing in cloud environments. Data owners can outsource their encrypted data to the cloud using identity-based encryption, while proxy re-encryption construction will grant legitimate users access to the data. With the Internet of Things devices being resource-constrained, an edge device acts as a 
proxy server to handle intensive computations. Also, we make use of the features of information-centric networking to deliver cached content in the proxy effectively, thus improving the quality of service and making good use of the network bandwidth. Further, our system model is based on blockchain, a disruptive 
technology that enables decentralization in data sharing. It mitigates the bottlenecks in centralized systemsand achieves fine-grained access control to data. The security analysis and evaluation of our scheme show the promise of our approach in ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and security.

#  PROPOSED SYSTEM AND ADVANTAGES 
The system proposes a secure access control framework to realize data confidentiality, and fine
grained access to data are achieved. This will also guarantee data owners’ complete control over their data. 
 The system gives a detailed description of our PRE scheme and the actualization of a complete protocol 
that guarantees security and privacy of data.  To improve data delivery and effectively utilize the network 
bandwidth, edge devices serve as proxy nodes and perform re-encryption on the cached data. The edge 
devices are assumed to have enough computation capabilities than the IoT devices and as such provide high 
performance networking.  The security analysis of our scheme is presented, and we also test and   
performance with existing schemes.  
 
# Advantages  
1) The proposed system is secure against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. MITM attacks get to 
the certificate authority CA) to provide the user with forged public keys. 
 2) The proposed system finds Data Tampering and blocks when hackers compromise a system, they 
inject their own versions of the


# Modules Description: 
# Modules  
# Data Owner Module  
In this module, the data owner uploads their data in the public cloud server. For the security 
purpose the data owner encrypts the data file and assigns the digital sign and then store in the 
cloud. The data owner can check the data integrity of the file over Corresponding cloud server. 
The Data owner can have capable of manipulating the encrypted data file and data owner can 
update the file contents as well as delete his own file. 
# Key Generation  Centre 
In this module, the KGC Generates the Secret Key requested by the data user, the KGC checks 
the file if present generates the appropriate Secret Key. The KG-CSP allows viewing the Secret 
Key generated files and also the transactions related to the file. 
# Proxy Server 
The server will manage and authorize Users and maintain all data transactions between data 
owner and cloud server, end user. 
 
# Data User Module 
In this module, Data user logs in by using his user name and password. After he will request for 
secret key of required file from CSP, and get the secrete key from KGC. After getting secrete key 
he is trying to download file by entering file name and secrete key from cloud server.  
 
# Data Encryption and Decryption  
All the legal users in the system can freely query any interested encrypted and decrypted data. 
Upon receiving the data from the server, the user runs the decryption algorithm Decrypt to 
decrypt the cipher text by using its secret keys from different Users. Only the attributes the user 
possesses satisfy the access structure defined in the cipher text CT, the user can get the content. 
 
# Attacker Module  
In Data user module, while downloading time if remote user enters wrong trapdoor or secrete key 
then he is treated as Digital sign attacker or Secret Key attacker.  
 
# Data Integrity Check 
 
Data will be verified in the cloud to check it is integrated by attacker or not. If it is integrated 
then it is recovering from the data owner.
