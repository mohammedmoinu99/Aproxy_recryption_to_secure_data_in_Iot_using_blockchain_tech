In this example, each line represents a data entry at a specific timestamp for a particular vehicle involved in transportation and logistics operations. The fields include:

Timestamp: The date and time when the data entry was recorded.
VehicleID: An identifier for the vehicle.
Location: The latitude and longitude coordinates of the vehicle's current location.
Speed: The speed of the vehicle in miles per hour (or any preferred unit).
FuelLevel: The remaining fuel level of the vehicle as a percentage.
ShipmentStatus: The status of the shipment associated with the vehicle (e.g., "In Transit," "Delayed," "Delivered").
