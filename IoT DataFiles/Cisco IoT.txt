	In this example, the data includes the following fields:

Timestamp: The date and time of the data measurement.
Voltage (V): The voltage level recorded at that specific time.
Current (A): The current value measured at that specific time.
Power (W): The calculated power based on the voltage and current readings.
Energy Consumption (kWh): The cumulative energy consumption up to that point, measured in kilowatt-hours.
Each row represents a data point captured at a particular time interval, such as every five minutes. The data can be further expanded with additional fields or customized based on specific requirements and the available data from Energy and Utilities IoT devices.
